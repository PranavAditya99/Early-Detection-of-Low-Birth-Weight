# Early-Detection-of-Low-Birth-Weight
Low Birth weight (LBW) acts as an indicator of sickness in newborn babies. LBW is closely associated with infant mortality as well as various health outcomes later in life. Various studies show strong correlation between maternal health during pregnancy and the childâ€™s birth weight. Exploit machine learning techniques to gain useful information from health indicators of pregnant women for early detection of potential LBW cases. The forecasting problem should be reformulated as a classification problem between LBW and NOT-LBW classes.
